### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Lanie.
#### I am a Software Engineering student at Auburn University.
My journey in coding began with a fascination for problem-solving and has since evolved into a college experience dedicated to learning to creating software that makes a difference. I am proficient in Python, Java, and C++. Throughout my time at Auburn, I have had the opportunity to work in a group setting while learning, allowing me to grow used to relying on my team for assistance. Beyond the code, Iâ€™m an advocate for continuous learning and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me reading or writing.

Skills: Python / Java / C++ / HTML / CSS / MIPS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MIPS/Assembly 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
